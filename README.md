This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio webpage, designed as a single-page website to effectively present my projects, skills, and contact information. The site utilizes HTML for structural organization and CSS for comprehensive styling, including custom fonts, a personalized color scheme, and subtle animations to enhance user engagement.

**Built With:**

* **HTML:** Used to create the semantic structure of the webpage, organizing content into key sections such as an introduction, a showcase of projects, and contact details. The single-page layout is achieved through careful structuring and linking of these sections.
* **CSS:** Employed for the visual design and styling of the portfolio. This includes:
    * Implementing a custom color palette to create a unique and professional aesthetic.
    * Integrating custom fonts to enhance typography and visual appeal.
    * Applying CSS animations to add subtle interactive elements and improve the overall user experience.
    * Utilizing layout techniques (like Flexbox or Grid) to arrange elements effectively within the single-page structure.

**What I Learned:**

Through the development of this portfolio webpage, I gained valuable experience and reinforced my understanding of:

* **Single-Page Website Architecture:** Planning and structuring content for a seamless single-page navigation experience using HTML anchors and potentially smooth scrolling techniques.
* **Advanced CSS Styling:** Mastering more intricate CSS properties and techniques for creating visually appealing and professional designs.
* **Custom Font Integration:** Learning how to incorporate and manage custom fonts to enhance the website's typography.
* **Color Theory and Application:** Practicing the selection and implementation of a cohesive and effective color scheme.
* **CSS Animations:** Understanding and applying CSS animations to add subtle interactivity and visual flair without relying on JavaScript.
* **Layout Management:** Further practice with CSS layout models (Flexbox and/or Grid) to arrange different sections and elements within the single-page design.
* **Best Practices for Online Portfolios:** Considering user experience and the effective presentation of personal and professional information online.

This project serves as a dynamic and visually engaging representation of my skills and projects, demonstrating my front-end development capabilities in creating a compelling online portfolio using fundamental web technologies.
